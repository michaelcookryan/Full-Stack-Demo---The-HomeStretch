# homestretch
Full-stack app with low level login for a registered massage therapist to assign a custom list of videos for the client to follow between appointments. Tech stack is MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), as well as SASS using the BEM methodology.

This was my capstone project I created for the BrainStation Web Development diploma in the summer of 2019.
(Requires an npm install in both the client and server directories, and MongoDB connection string)
